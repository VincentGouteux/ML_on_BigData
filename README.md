# ML_on_BigData
Course project (In collaboration with Louis Monier) of Machine Learning on BigData, Implemating various gradient descent methods using pyspark and map reduce.
All the algorithm are available in the following paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04747.pdf

There are two notebooks implementing all the 11 variants of gradient descent. The first is applied on a 'toy' dataset that we generated with some blank noise. The other one is over a real dataset, the Boston dataset given by scikit learn
